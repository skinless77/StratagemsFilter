# StratagemsFilter

For the past few days, I have been developing a script that allows you to generate from a BattleScribe army list in .rosz format a list of stratagems that can be used according to the keywords of your faction and of each unit. The stratagems are exported from wa*apedia.

To use it, just execute it, you will be asked to fetch your roster in .rosz format. Validate and the list of stratagems will appear.
